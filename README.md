A library of algebraic methods, written in Java.

<h1>Goal</h1>
The end-goal of this project is to build a library that can solve systems of equations of varying degrees. I also would like to build in functionality for graphing equations, but that may be included in a different project since this library is centered around the solving of mathematical expressions, not necessarily their representations.

<h1>Current State</h1>
The current state of the project is the expression phase. Right now, a new format and method of parsing mathematical expressions is being implemented, and it should soon yield the ability to simplify mathematical expressions.

<h1>Next Step</h1>
The next step after completing the expression phase is to implement functionality for solving linear equations. This should be relatively straightforward, as it only involves linking two expressions together.

<h1>Planned Features</h1>
- Solving linear equations/inequalities
- Solving systems of linear equations/inequalities
- Suport for trigonometric functions
